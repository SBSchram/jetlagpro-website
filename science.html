            <div class="block-content">
              <ul>
                <li>We all have our own circadian rhythm - our personal 24-hour clock.</li>
                <li>This clock tells us when to feel sleepy, when to be alert, and regulates many other body functions.</li>
                <li>Even our individual cells have their own timekeepers.</li>
                <li>Recent research shows that acupuncture can reset our body's internal clock.</li>

              <h3>Ancient wisdom from Chinese Medicine offers a solution</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="block-content">
              <p>Chinese medicine has understood our body's natural rhythms for thousands of years. They discovered that different systems in our body are most active during specific two-hour periods throughout the day. JetLagPro leverages that concept into an accessible technique anyone can use.</p>
