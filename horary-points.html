            <h2>The Chinese Organ Clock</h2>
            <p>According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), each of the twelve meridians has a daily two-hour window when it is most active, known as "Horary Time." This creates a 24-hour cycle where different organ systems are energetically dominant at specific times.</p>
            
            <p>The most fascinating aspect of this system is that when you stimulate the horary point associated with your destination time—rather than your current time—you help your body begin syncing with the new time zone in advance. This technique signals your internal clock to shift from the departure time zone toward your destination's rhythm.</p>

            <p><em>The Chinese Organ Clock shows each meridian's peak activity time and its associated element. Each point aligns with one of the twelve meridians and its peak energetic activity.</em></p>

        <h2>The 12 Horary Points</h2>
        <p>Each point is stimulated during its corresponding two-hour window to support the function of that meridian. Here are the 12 points used in JetLagPro:</p>

            <h2>How This Works for Jet Lag</h2>
            <p>When you travel across time zones, your body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) remains synchronized with your departure time zone. By stimulating the horary points associated with your destination time zone, you're essentially "telling" your body what time it should be at your destination.</p>
            
            <p>For example, if you're flying from New York to London (5-hour time difference), and it's 3:00 PM in New York but 8:00 PM in London, you would stimulate the point that's active at 8:00 PM (Pericardium-8) rather than the point active at 3:00 PM (Small Intestine-5).</p>
            
            <p>This technique helps your body begin the process of adjusting to the new time zone before you even arrive, potentially reducing the severity and duration of jet lag symptoms.</p>
