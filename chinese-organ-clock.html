                    <h2>Understanding the Chinese Organ Clock</h2>
                    <p>The Chinese Organ Clock, documented in classical texts such as the <em>Huangdi Neijing</em> (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon), describes a 24-hour cycle where energy (Qi) flows through the 12 primary meridians in a predictable sequence. Each meridian and its associated organ system reaches peak activity during a specific two-hour period.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Jet Lag</h3>
                    <p>When we travel across time zones, our internal clock continues operating on our departure time while our destination operates on a different schedule. This creates a mismatch between our body's natural rhythms and the external environment. The Chinese Organ Clock provides a framework for understanding how to help the body adapt to new time zones by stimulating specific acupuncture points during their peak activity periods.</p>

                    <h3>Horary Points</h3>
                    <p>Within each meridian, specific acupuncture points called "horary points" become particularly potent when stimulated during their meridian's peak activity period. These points represent the optimal intersection of temporal organization and therapeutic intervention.</p>
